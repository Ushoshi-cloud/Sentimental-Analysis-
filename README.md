# Sentiment Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

This project analyzes Amazon product reviews using two methods:

* VADER (NLTK) – A rule-based sentiment analyzer
* Roberta (Hugging Face Transformers) – A deep learning-based model

##  What’s Inside

* Load and explore review data
* Apply NLTK for tokenization, POS tagging, and VADER sentiment scoring
* Use Roberta to analyze sentiment with context
* Visualize and compare sentiment scores
* Run everything inside a Jupyter Notebook

##  Tools & Libraries

* `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `nltk` (with VADER and POS tagging)
* `transformers`, `torch`
* `scipy`, `tqdm`

##  Note

Run this in Jupyter Notebook for best interactivity.
Install missing packages with `!pip install` commands in the notebook itself.
